## But Why?

This started as a playground to try elm-ui, but it is here as a proof of concept for a plugin-based reusable UI (for now based on an iframe) and code sample for a question on StackOverflow

the idea is to have external components bundled in self-contained html files, fetch those files at startup time based on yaml config files, and run the components in sandboxed iframes

I guess web components are a more elegant way to solve this "problem", but I wanted to take a shot at solving this "the naive way"

To try it, just run ```elm reactor``` and open Main.elm
