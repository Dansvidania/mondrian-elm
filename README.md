## But Whyâ€½

This started as a playground to try elm-ui, but it is here as a proof of concept for a plugin-based reusable UI (for now based on an infamous iframe) and code sample for a question on StackOverflow

the idea is to have external components bundled in self-contained html files, fetch those files at startup time based on yaml config files, and run the components in sandboxed iframes

I guess web components are a more elegant way to solve this "problem", but I wanted to take a shot at solving this "the naive way"

To try it, just run ```elm reactor``` and open Main.elm

Lol, really? :D

## Oh and also why Mondrian?

[here is why](https://www.google.com/search?q=piet+mondrian&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49tDcy6jjAhW0wcQBHYT4CsgQ_AUIECgB&biw=1225&bih=798)

Mondrian is the guy that made those cool geometric paintings, and every time I think of tiles and components and cards (not very often, I am a backend dev as you can see by the overflow of colors and style in the POC) I think Mondrian. 


## Moar trivia(l information)

Yes, thats an Interrobang up on the first line. Yes, it's a thing. Yes it's also a word. Yes it's in the cambridge dictionary.
I know, I have lost a bet on this too, somebody is to blame and I will find him, but in the meantime I gotta use it.
